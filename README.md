# Infra as Code Example - Implementing an API enviroment

## Objective

A list of examples for automate API service infrastructure implementation, using Terraform, Docker and Cloud Providers (AWS, Azure and GCP). My proposal is presenting ways of implementing API service, from basic to complex level.

**Note:** I have not intetion to talk about advanced security, SWE approachings or specific configurations of Cloud Providers in these examples :)

## Format

I separated the approaches in specific branches:

- [main](https://github.com/rafaelvilarinho/iac-docker-api): latest implementation of NodeJS API
- [simple-service-api](https://github.com/rafaelvilarinho/iac-docker-api/tree/simple-server-api): simple implementation of NodeJS API
